>Suppose that the probabilities are 0.2, 0.4, 0.3 and 0.1 that the number of wills filed on any day at Kusu Island will be 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
>(a) What is the probability of having at least 2 wills filed per day?
>(b) Find the expected number of wills filed per day.
>(c) Find the variance of the number of wills filed per day.

(a) $P(\text{at least 2 wills}) = P(\text{2 wills filled}) + P(\text{3 wills filled}) = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4$
(b) $$ \begin{align} 
E(X) &= (0* 0.2) + (1 * 0.4) + (2 * 0.3) + (3 * 0.1) \\ 
&= 1.3
\end{align}$$
(c) $$\begin{align}
Var(X) &= E(X^2) - E(X)^2 \\
&= 0^2(0.2) + 1^2(0.4) + 2^2(0.3) + 3^2(0.1) - (0.4)^2 \\ &
= 2.5 - 0.16 \\ &

>Given that f (x) = $k/2^x$, is a discrete probability function for a r.v. that can take on the values
x = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Find k and tabulate the cumulative probability P(Xâ‰¤ x).

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= \frac{k}{2^x} \\

\frac{31k}{16} &= 1 \\
k &= \frac{16}{31} \\
&\approx{0.516}

>The number of calls coming per minute into a hotel reservation center is Poisson random
variable with mean 3.
(a) Find the probability that no calls come in a given 1minute period.
(b) Assume that the number of calls arriving in two different minutes are independent.
Find the probability that at least two calls will arrive in a given two minutes period.

$$
\begin{align}

(a) \
